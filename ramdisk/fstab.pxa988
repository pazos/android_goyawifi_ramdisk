## fstab has the following format:
##
## Any line starting with a # is a comment and ignored
##
## Any blank line is ignored
##
## All other lines must be in this format:
##   <source>  <mount_point> <fs_type> <mount_flags> <fs_options> <fs_mgr_options>
##
##   <mount_flags> is a comma separated list of flags that can be passed to the
##                 mount command.  The list includes noatime, nosuid, nodev, nodiratime,
##                 ro, rw, remount, defaults.
##
##   <fs_options> is a comma separated list of options accepted by the filesystem being
##                mounted.  It is passed directly to mount without being parsed
##
##   <fs_mgr_options> is a comma separated list of flags that control the operation of
##                     the fs_mgr program.  The list includes "wait", which will wait till
##                     the <source> file exists, and "check", which requests that the fs_mgr
##                     run an fscheck program on the <source> before mounting the filesystem.
##                     If check is specifed on a read-only filesystem, it is ignored.
##                     Also, "encryptable" means that filesystem can be encrypted.
##                     The "encryptable" flag _MUST_ be followed by a : and a string which
##                     is the location of the encryption keys.  I can either be a path
##                     to a file or partition which contains the keys, or the word "footer"
##                     which means the keys are in the last 16 Kbytes of the partition
##                     containing the filesystem.
##
## When the fs_mgr is requested to mount all filesystems, it will first mount all the
## filesystems that do _NOT_ specify check (including filesystems that are read-only and
## specify check, because check is ignored in that case) and then it will check and mount
## filesystem marked with check.
